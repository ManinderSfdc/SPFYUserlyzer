# SPFYUserlyzer

**Description**
- The python script screen scrapes the data storage by record, by user (based on SOQL) in
  Salesforce org and export the results to an Excel spreadsheet.
- Works only in Salesforce classic but can be extended for lightning as well.
- The script scrapes the data from the URL https://<salesforce org
  URL>/setup/user/userstorageusage.jsp?id=005r0000005BrMAAU, where 005r0000005BrMAAU is the  
  user Id.
- Uses simple-salesforce, selenium and chromedriver libraries for automation.
- Provides flexibility to configure the SOQL based on which the export is generated.   
- Modify the `resources/config.py` file with your salesforce credentials and other settings to use the app.
- A 30 seconds wait is added to the `SPFYUserlyzer.py` after login to allow the user to complete 2FA or identity verification. You can increase this wait as desired.
  
To run the script from terminal:
`python3 <PATH to SPFYUserlyzer.py>/SPFYUserlyzer.py`
